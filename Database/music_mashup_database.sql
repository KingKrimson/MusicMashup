(1, 'Nevermind', '1991-09-24', 'Nevermind is the second studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the group''s first release on DGC Records. Frontman Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and their use of song volume dynamics.  Despite low commercial expectations by the band and its record label, Nevermind became a surprise success in late 1991, largely due to the popularity of its first single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit". By January 1992, it had replaced Michael Jackson''s album Dangerous at number one on the Billboard charts. The album also produced three other successful singles: "Come as You Are", "Lithium", and "In Bloom". The Recording Industry Association of America has certified the album Diamond (over 10 million copies shipped), and the album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Nevermind was responsible for bringing alternative rock to a large mainstream audience, and critics subsequently regarded it as one of the best albums of all time.', './Images/AlbumImages/Nevermind.jpg', 4),
(2, 'In Utero', '1993-09-13', 'In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993, on DGC Records. Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain''s outlook on his publicized personal life and his band''s newfound fame.  Soon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable. Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the group was not fully satisfied with the sound Albini had captured. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired Scott Litt to make minor changes to the album''s sound and remix the singles "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies".  Upon release, In Utero entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold 3.58 million copies in the United States alone.', './Images/AlbumImages/Inutero.jpg', 4),
(3, 'Bleach', '1989-06-15', 'Bleach is the debut studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released in June 1989 through the independent record label Sub Pop. The main recording sessions took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington between December 1988 and January 1989. Nirvana songwriter Kurt Cobain felt pressured to create music for Bleach that conformed to the grunge music style favored by his record label and the contemporary Seattle music scene. The album is regarded as quite negative and bleak; Cobain claimed that most of the lyrics were written the night before recording while he was feeling "pissed off", and that he did not regard them highly. The recording of the album was financed by Jason Everman, who was credited as a guitarist but did not play on any songs.  Bleach was well received by critics, but failed to chart in the U.S. upon its original release. The album was re-released internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the success of Nirvana''s second album, Nevermind (1991). The re-release debuted at number 89 on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart and 34 on the Australian albums chart. In 2009 Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of Bleach featuring a live recording of a Nirvana show in Portland, Oregon from 1990 as extra material. Since its release in 1989, Bleach has sold over 1.7 million units in the United States alone. It is Sub Pop''s best-selling release to date.', './Images/AlbumImages/Bleach.jpg', 4),

It is a compilation of songs from Three Imaginary Boys, but replacing five of that album''s tracks with different tracks.', './Images/AlbumImages/Boysdontcry.jpg', 2),

(6, 'Disintegration', '1989-05-01', 'Disintegration is the eighth studio album by English alternative rock band The Cure, released on 1 May 1989 by Fiction Records. The record marks a return to the introspective and gloomy gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of thirty, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the group''s pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group''s new-found popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The Cure recorded Disintegration at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989. During production, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band.  In spite of Fiction''s fears that the album would be "commercial suicide", Disintegration became the band''s commercial peak. It charted at number three in the United Kingdom and at number twelve in the United States, and produced several hit singles including "Lovesong", which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Disintegration remains The Cure''s highest selling record to date, with more than three million copies sold worldwide. Disintegration was also a critical success, eventually being placed at number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine''s list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the "culmination of all the musical directions The Cure were pursuing over the course of the ''80s."', './Images/AlbumImages/Disintegration.jpg', 2),
(7, 'Ten', '1991-08-27', 'Ten is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on August 27, 1991 through Epic Records. Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard''s previous group Mother Love Bone, the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse.  Ten was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: "Alive", "Even Flow", and "Jeremy". While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream. The album has been certified diamond by the RIAA in the United States. As of December 2012, it has sold 9,983,000 copies in the U.S., and remains Pearl Jam''s most commercially successful album.', './Images/AlbumImages/Ten.jpg', 3),

After a relentless touring schedule in support of their 1991 debut album Ten, Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. The resulting album, Vs., featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band''s previous release. It was the band''s first collaboration with producer Brendan O''Brien.  Pearl Jam decided to scale back its commercial efforts for Vs., including declining to produce music videos for any of the album’s singles. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week, a record it held for five years. Vs. occupied the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA in the United States.', './Images/AlbumImages/Vs.jpg', 3),

It was released on 12 November 1984 by the band''s British record company, Rough Trade, just months after the band''s debut, The Smiths. The album reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for 46 weeks. Eventually, on 9 November 1993, it was also released by their American label, Sire Records, which had initially declined to release the album. Sire instead released Louder Than Bombs in the US in 1987, which contains several of the same tracks as on Hatful of Hollow, as well as The World Won''t Listen.  In 2000, Q magazine placed Hatful of Hollow at number 44 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.', './Images/AlbumImages/Hatfulofhollow.jpg', 1),

The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the chart for 33 weeks. After the original production by Troy Tate was felt to be inadequate, John Porter rerecorded the album in both London and Manchester during breaks in the band''s UK tour during September 1983. The album was well received by the critics as well as the public, and it established The Smiths as a prominent band in the 1980s music scene in the United Kingdom.', './Images/AlbumImages/Thesmiths.jpg', 1),
(11, 'Core', '1992-09-29', 'Core is the debut album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on September 29, 1992 through Atlantic Records. The album, which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #3 on the Billboard 200, was certified 8x platinum by the RIAA on December 18, 2001, making it the band''s best-selling album.', './Images/AlbumImages/Core.jpg', 5),
(12, 'Purple', '1994-06-07', 'Purple is the second studio album released by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots released in June 1994 on Atlantic Records. The album, building off the foundations laid by the band''s debut album Core, was a huge success for the band, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and remaining there for three weeks, eventually selling over six million copies. It spawned a number of successful singles — "Vasoline", and "Interstate Love Song" both topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, while "Big Empty" also cracked the top ten. Lesser known album cuts "Pretty Penny" and "Unglued" were also released as promotional radio singles.  The album''s style sees an expansion of the band''s sound. While the band''s debut, Core, had a more grunge-oriented sound with churning guitar riffs and aggressive vocals, Purple saw the band shift to a more alternative rock-style, incorporating a number of influences, including psychedelic and southern rock.  In 2006, the album was ranked number 73 on Guitar World magazine''s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.', './Images/AlbumImages/Purple.jpg', 5),
(13, 'Badmotorfinger', '1991-09-08', 'Badmotorfinger is the third studio album by the American rock band Soundgarden, released on October 8, 1991 through A&M Records. After touring in support of its previous album, Louder Than Love (1989), Soundgarden began the recording sessions for its next album with new bassist Ben Shepherd. The music on the album maintained the band''s heavy metal sound while featuring an increased focus on songwriting as compared with the band''s previous releases.[1]  The focus on the Seattle grunge scene helped bring attention to Badmotorfinger. The singles "Outshined" and "Rusty Cage" were able to find an audience at rock radio and MTV. Badmotorfinger became the band''s highest charting album at the time on the Billboard 200. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe, including opening for Guns N'' Roses on that band''s Use Your Illusion Tour. In 1992, Badmotorfinger was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. The album has been certified two times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States, and had, by October 2010, sold 1,517,000 copies in the United States', './Images/AlbumImages/Badmotorfinger.jpg', 6),

After touring in support of its first full-length studio album, Ultramega OK (1988), Soundgarden signed with A&M and began work on its first album for a major label. The songs on the album featured a metal-leaning grunge sound with some songs featuring unusual or unorthodox time signatures.  Because of some of the song lyrics, a Parental Advisory sticker was placed on the album packaging. Louder Than Love would become the band''s first album to chart on the Billboard 200. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe. It was the last Soundgarden album to feature the band''s original bassist, Hiro Yamamoto.', './Images/AlbumImages/Louderthanlove.jpg', 6),
(15, 'Surfer Rosa', '1988-03-21', 'Surfer Rosa is the first full-length album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in March 1988 on the British independent record label 4AD. The album''s unusual and offbeat subject matter includes references to mutilation and voyeurism; this is augmented by experimental recording, low-fidelity production and a distinctive drum sound. Surfer Rosa contains many of the elements present in Pixies'' earlier output, including Spanish lyrics and references to Puerto Rico.  Because of 4AD''s independent status, distribution in the United States was handled by British label Rough Trade Records; however, it failed to chart in either the UK or the U.S. "Gigantic" was the only single taken from the release (in a re-recorded version), and only reached number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite this, Surfer Rosa was re-released in the U.S. by Elektra Records in 1992, and in 2005 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.  Surfer Rosa is often cited as a favorite of music critics, and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums. Many alternative rock artists, including Billy Corgan and PJ Harvey, have cited the album as inspirational; Nirvana''s Kurt Cobain frequently acknowledged that Surfer Rosa was a strong influence on Nevermind, and in 1993 hired the album''s producer Steve Albini to produce his band''s album In Utero.', './Images/AlbumImages/Surferrosa.jpg', 7),

The album features a wide array of styles, as well as greater musical input from bassist D''arcy Wretzky and second guitarist James Iha.  Led by the single "Bullet with Butterfly Wings", the record debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the only such occurrence for the group. The album spawned five more singles—"1979", "Zero", "Tonight, Tonight", the promotional "Muzzle", and "Thirty-Three"—over the course of 1996, and has been certified diamond by the RIAA. Praised by critics for its ambition and scope, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness earned the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 1997, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year ("1979").', './Images/AlbumImages/Melloncollieandtheinfinitesadness.jpg', 8),

A critical and commercial success, the album sold 19,000 units in the United States in its debut week, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. The album signals a departure from the musical style of Opeth''s past albums, being one of only two albums by the band not to feature death growls (the other being Damnation).', './Images/AlbumImages/Heritage.jpg', 9),
(18, 'OK Computer', '1997-05-21', 'OK Computer is the third studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released in 1997 on Parlophone and Capitol Records. OK Computer was the first self-produced Radiohead album, with assistance from Nigel Godrich. Radiohead recorded the album in Oxfordshire and Bath between 1996 and early 1997, with most of the recording completed in the historic mansion St. Catherine''s Court. The band made a deliberate attempt to distance themselves from the guitar-oriented, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer''s abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and wide range of influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead''s later, more experimental work.  Upon the album''s delivery to Capitol, label representatives lowered their sales estimates, deeming the record uncommercial. Nevertheless, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the band''s highest album entry on the American charts at the time, debuting at number 21 on the Billboard 200. Three songs from the album—"Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises"—were released as promotional singles. The album expanded Radiohead''s worldwide popularity and has sold over three million copies to date.  OK Computer received considerable acclaim upon release. Prominent British and American rock critics predicted the album would have far-reaching cultural impact. In subsequent years, the album has been frequently cited by listeners, critics and musicians as one of the greatest of its time. OK Computer initiated a shift away from the popular Britpop genre of the time to the more melancholic and atmospheric style of alternative rock that would be prevalent in the next decade. Critics and fans often comment on the underlying themes found in the lyrics and artwork, emphasising Radiohead''s views on rampant consumerism, social alienation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer is often interpreted as having prescient insight into the mood of 21st century life.', './Images/AlbumImages/Okcomputer.jpg', 10),

Blackwater Park did not chart in North America or the United Kingdom. The album had two singles released from it: "The Drapery Falls" and "Still Day Beneath the Sun". Blackwater Park was highly acclaimed on its initial release and has been praised by critics, with Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic stating that the album is "surely the band''s coming-of-age album, and therefore, an ideal introduction to its remarkable body of work."', './Images/AlbumImages/Blackwaterpark.jpg', 9);

Based on the song writing partnership of vocalist Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, the band also included bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. The group was signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records, on which they released four studio albums, several compilations, and numerous non-LP singles. Although they had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together, and never released a single that charted higher than number 10 in their home country, The Smiths won a significant following, and remain cult and commercial favourites. The band broke up in 1987 and have turned down several offers to reunite.'),
(2, 'The Cure', 'The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with frontman, vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with its debut album Three Imaginary Boys (1979); this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and New Wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band''s increasingly dark and tormented music helped form the gothic rock genre. After the release of Pornography (1982), the band''s future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the 1982 single "Let''s Go to Bed" Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band''s music (as well as a unique stage look). The Cure''s popularity increased as the decade wore on, especially in the United States where the songs "Just Like Heaven", "Lovesong" and "Friday I''m in Love" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart. By the start of the 1990s, The Cure were one of the most popular alternative rock bands in the world. The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004. The Cure have released thirteen studio albums, 10 EPs and over thirty singles during the course of their career. Since 2010, they have been working on a fourteenth studio album.'),

The band''s current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.  Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament''s previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band''s career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame." To date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the ''90s."'),

Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.  In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from the band''s second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana''s sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band''s frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the "spokesman of a generation", with Nirvana being considered the "flagship band" of Generation X. Nirvana''s third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group''s audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a commercial success.  Nirvana''s brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain''s widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide.'),

STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since.  While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band have shown a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band''s evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland''s well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.'),

Soundgarden was one of the seminal bands in the creation of grunge, a style of alternative rock that developed in Seattle, and was one of a number of grunge bands signed to the record label Sub Pop. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A&M Records, in 1988), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized the genre in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam.  Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles "Black Hole Sun" and "Spoonman". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. After several years working on projects and other bands, Soundgarden reunited in 2010 and their sixth studio album, King Animal, was released two years later.

The group disbanded in 1993 under acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004.  The band''s style of music contains a range of elements, including indie rock, psychedelia, noise rock, and surf rock. Black Francis is the Pixies'' primary songwriter and singer. He has written about a number of offbeat subjects in the band''s songs, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence.  The group is credited as being a big influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. The Pixies'' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004.'),
(8, 'Smashing Pumpkins', 'Smashing Pumpkins is an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, lead guitar) and James Iha (rhythm guitar), the band has included Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), D''arcy Wretzky (bass guitar), Melissa Auf der Maur (bass guitar), and currently includes Mike Byrne (drums), Nicole Fiorentino (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Jeff Schroeder (rhythm guitar) among its membership.  Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, the Pumpkins have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing-style production, and, in later recordings, electronica. Corgan is the group''s primary songwriter—his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band''s albums and songs, which have been described as "anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan''s nightmare-land". The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993''s Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 19.75 million albums sold in the United States, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.  In 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. The band toured with a rotating lineup of between five and nine musicians through much of 2007 and 2008 with new member Jeff Schroeder before Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. New drummer Mike Byrne and bassist Nicole Fiorentino solidified a new lineup with Corgan and Schroeder, toured through much of 2010 and 2011, and are currently recording the album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, having just released the album-within-an-album Oceania.'),
(9, 'Opeth', 'Opeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth''s driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as noticeable influences from black metal and death metal, most notably in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.  Opeth has released ten studio albums, three live DVDs, three live albums (two that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, Ghost Reveries, was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, Watershed, which peaked at number twenty-three on the Billboard 200, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. Opeth has sold over 2 million albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective Soundscans of their albums Blackwater Park, Damnation and Deliverance in the United States.'),
(10, 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O''Brien (guitar, backing vocals).  Radiohead released their debut single "Creep" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead''s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead''s third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.  Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead''s musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarising at the time of its release, is now frequently recognised as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band''s final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead''s eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.  Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band''s work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics'' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone''s list of "The Greatest Artists of All Time", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O''Brien were both included in Rolling Stone''s list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.');

(1, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', '"Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band''s second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic.  The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana''s biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.  "Smells Like Teen Spirit" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics'' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X,[2][3] but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain''s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.', 1, 4),
(2, 'Come as You Are', '"Come as You Are" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by frontman Kurt Cobain and released as the second single from the band''s second studio album Nevermind in 1992. It was the band''s second American Top 40 hit, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for "Come as You Are" was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who drew inspiration for it from the cover artwork of Nevermind.', 1, 4),
(3, 'Lithium', '"Lithium" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by frontman Kurt Cobain. Veering between quiet verses and loud choruses, "Lithium" is about a man who turns to religion amid thoughts of suicide. Nirvana first recorded "Lithium" in 1990 with producer Butch Vig, then re-recorded the song with Vig the following year for the group''s second album Nevermind (1991).  Released as the third single from Nevermind in July 1992, "Lithium" peaked at number 64 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video, directed by Kevin Kerslake, is a montage of concert footage.', 1, 4),
(4, 'In Bloom', '"In Bloom" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana. Written by frontman Kurt Cobain, the song addresses people outside of the underground music community who did not understand the band''s message.  Nirvana made its first music video for an early version of "In Bloom" in 1990; however the song did not appear on a commercial release until the release of the group''s second album, Nevermind, in 1991. "In Bloom" became the fourth and final single from the album in late 1992. It was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows.', 1, 4),
(5, 'Heart-Shaped Box', '"Heart-Shaped Box" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. The song was released as the first single from the group''s third and final studio album, In Utero, in 1993. It was one of two songs from the album mixed by Scott Litt in order to augment the original production by producer Steve Albini. While Nirvana''s label DGC Records did not release a physical single for sale in the United States, "Heart-Shaped Box" received much American radio airplay, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The international release of the single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. The song''s music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, garnered critical plaudits.', 2, 4),
(6, 'All Apologies', '"All Apologies" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by frontman Kurt Cobain. It was released as the second single from the band''s third album, In Utero, which was released on September 21, 1993. It was released as a double A-side with the song "Rape Me". "All Apologies" was the band''s third number one Modern Rock hit and reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.', 2, 4),
(7, 'Rape Me', '"Rape Me" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by frontman Kurt Cobain. The song was released as the second single from Nirvana''s third album In Utero in 1993, packaged as a double A-side along with "All Apologies". The single reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart.', 2, 4),
(8, 'Blew', '"Blew" was written in 1988 by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The song was recorded in December 1988 and initially appeared as the first track on Nirvana''s 1989 debut album Bleach.', 3, 4),
(9, 'About a Girl', '"About a Girl" is a song by the American grunge band, Nirvana. It is the third song on the group''s debut album, Bleach (1989). It is also the first song on the posthumous MTV Unplugged in New York album from which it was a single in 1994.', 3, 4),
(10, 'Negative Creep', '"Negative Creep" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana from its 1989 debut album Bleach. The song was written by Kurt Cobain about himself, and how he claimed that he always saw himself as a negative person. It was named as one of the "Sub Popiest" grunge songs the band ever recorded. IGN called it "a textbook example of Seattle''s true grunge sound... featuring Cobain''s frantic wails and screaming on top of a repetitious and heavy grunge riff." The song has been also been described as "creepy" which works quite well with the title. "Negative Creep" is the only song on Bleach (including the reissued tracks), that does not end abruptly. Instead it fades out with the vocals, giving it a 60s pop aesthetic. The line "Daddy''s little girl ain''t a girl no more" shares similarities to Mudhoney''s "Sweet Young Thing Ain''t Sweet No More" from Superfuzz Bigmuff. Nirvana does not credit the song and the line was under the speculation of plagiarism. Some reviewers instead see the songs as an ode, not a ripoff, such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" being an ode to Pixies'' Debaser.', 3, 4),
(11, 'Killing an Arab', '"Killing an Arab" is the first single by The Cure. It was recorded at the same time as their first LP in the UK, Three Imaginary Boys (1979) but not included on the album. However it was included on the band''s first US album, Boys Don''t Cry (1980).', 4, 2),
(12, 'Boy''s Don''t Cry', '"Boys Don''t Cry" was the second single to be released by The Cure, released in June 1979. It was released in the UK as a stand-alone single, and was included as the title track on Boys Don''t Cry, the American equivalent to Three Imaginary Boys.', 4, 2),
(13, 'Jumping Someone Else''s Train', '"Jumping Someone Else''s Train" is a single by The Cure. The song was covered by the Brooklyn-based band "Luff" for the 2008 American Laundromat Records tribute album Just Like Heaven - A Tribute to The Cure and by Army Navy on Manimal Vinyl''s tribute Perfect as Cats: A Tribute to The Cure.', 4, 2),
(14, 'In Between Days', '"In Between Days" (sometimes listed as "Inbetween Days" or "In-Between Days") is a song by the English new wave/rock band The Cure.  The song was released as the first single from the band''s 1985 album The Head on the Door and was a big international success. In the UK, it was the band''s ninth chart single and their fourth consecutive Top 20 hit; while in the US it was their first single to reach the Billboard Hot 100 when it peaked at #99. It was a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand and also charted in several European countries, increasing the popularity of the band.  The song is poppy and upbeat, featuring strummed acoustic guitars under a snappy synthesizer riff, although the song''s lyrical themes of ageing, loss and fear do not particularly reflect the upbeat tempo of the music. The extended version, only released on the 12" single in North America, features quite a longer introduction to the song.', 5, 2),
(15, 'Close to Me', '"Close to Me" is a song by English rock group The Cure from their album The Head on the Door. On its original release, the single was most successful in Ireland, peaking at #4, also reaching #7 in Australia. It was remixed in 1990, which itself was released as a single, peaking at #13 on the UK singles chart and #97 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US in January 1991.', 5, 2),
(16, 'Lullaby', '"Lullaby" is a 1989 single by The Cure from their album Disintegration.', 6, 2),
(17, 'Fascination Street', '"Fascination Street" is a 1989 U.S.-only single by the rock band The Cure from their album Disintegration.  Their American record company refused the band''s original choice "Lullaby" as the first single (it was the lead single in the UK and was released in the U.S. later) and used "Fascination Street" instead. The song is notable for its extended bass introduction.  The song became the band''s first number-one single on Billboard''s then-newly-created Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it stayed on top for seven weeks.  An extended mix was also produced, notable in which the lyrics begin after a 4:00 instrumental intro.  The song is a playable track in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. ', 6, 2),
(18, 'Lovesong', '"Lovesong" (sometimes listed as "Love Song") is a song originally recorded by the English alternative rock band The Cure, released as the third single from their eighth studio album Disintegration in 1989. The song saw considerable success in the United States, where it was a #2 hit and the band''s only top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100; in the United Kingdom, the single charted at #18.  Though the song has been covered by several artists, the most famous and successful cover is the 2004 version by American reggae rock band 311, recorded for the soundtrack for the film 50 First Dates and also released as a single. This version actually charted higher on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart (reaching #1) than the Cure original (which peaked at #2). This song was also performed by Adele on her 2011 album 21.', 6, 2),
(19, 'Pictures of You', '"Pictures of You" is the fourth and final single from the British rock band The Cure''s 1989 album Disintegration. The single version is a remix edit of the album version, and at 4:48 minutes is significantly shorter than the original album version which runs for 7:24. There are also two different remixes on two UK 12" singles, and other singles released around the world, one of which later appeared on Mixed Up as the Extended Dub Mix and differs significantly from the album version in arrangement in that incorporates wholly original drum and bass arrangements. The other is an extended remix of the original album version which, at 7:59, runs slightly longer than the album version. There is also an edit which was released on 12" in the US, titled "extended remix" as in the European and Australasian releases, but which runs for 6:40 rather than 7:59.  According to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith''s home. After that day, Smith was going through the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture was used as the cover of the "Charlotte Sometimes" single, but that version was heavily warped and distorted.  In 2003, Hewlett-Packard used the song in a commercial for digital photography products.  In 2004, the song was voted 278th on Rolling Stone''s "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  A cover of the song is featured on Lit''s 2004 self-titled album. It is also featured in the 2007 documentary, The King of Kong.  In 2008, a cover version by Angie Hart, was used for a Victorian (Australia) government campaign to combat speeding drivers. In 2009, the song was featured on One Tree Hill''s episode "A Kiss To Build A Dream On", where Peyton and Lucas embark on a road trip to see The Cure live in concert.  In 2012, the song appeared in the closing scene of the film, The Vow.', 6, 2),
(20, 'Alive', '"Alive" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. "Alive" was Pearl Jam''s first single, and appeared on the band''s debut album, Ten (1991). Written by guitarist Stone Gossard, "Alive" originated as an instrumental titled "Dollar Short" and was included on a demo tape circulated in hopes of finding a singer for the group. Vocalist Eddie Vedder obtained a copy of the tape and wrote lyrics that describe a fictionalized account (though somewhat based on Vedder''s personal experience) of the time when he was told that the man he thought was his father was not actually his biological parent. "Alive" charted at number 16 in the UK (the single was available only through import in the US). Remixed versions of the song were included on Pearl Jam''s 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003), and the 2009 Ten reissue. The song peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.', 7, 3),
(21, 'Even Flow', '"Even Flow" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, "Even Flow" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band''s debut album, Ten (1991). The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam''s 2004 greatest hits album, rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003). A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 Ten reissue.', 7, 3),
(22, 'Jeremy', '"Jeremy" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam, with lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by bassist Jeff Ament. "Jeremy" was released in 1992 as the third single from Pearl Jam''s debut album Ten (1991). The song was inspired by a newspaper article Vedder read about a high school student who killed himself in front of his classmates. It reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. It did not originally chart on the regular Billboard Hot 100 singles chart since it was not released as a commercial single in the U.S. at the time, but a re-release in July 1995 brought it up to number 79. The song gained notoriety for its music video, directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992, which received heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. In 1993, the "Jeremy" video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.', 7, 3),

Although credited to all members of Pearl Jam, it features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music primarily written by guitarist Stone Gossard. The song topped both the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock Billboard charts. The song spent a total of eight weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. "Daughter" eventually peaked at number 28 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart, becoming the band''s first Top 40 single.

(26, 'Animal', '"Animal" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released in 1994 as the third single from the band''s second studio album, Vs. (1993).

(28, 'What Difference Does It Make?', '"What Difference Does It Make?" is a 1984 single by British band The Smiths. The single version can be found on the band''s self-titled debut album The Smiths. A different version recorded for the John Peel Show on BBC Radio One is featured on the compilation album Hatful of Hollow.', 10, 1),
(29, 'William, It Was Really Nothing', '"William, It Was Really Nothing" is a song by British band The Smiths. It was released as a single on 24 August 1984, featuring the B-sides "Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want" and "How Soon Is Now?", and reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is featured on the compilation albums Hatful of Hollow and Louder Than Bombs as well as other best of and singles collections. In 2004 the song was ranked number 425 on Rolling Stone magazine''s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  The original artwork depicted comes from an early 80s advertisement for A.D.S. speakers (the object on the bed is a speaker), however due to legal reasons later pressings were produced with new artwork, a lilac-tinted still of Billie Whitelaw from the film Charlie Bubbles, directed by Albert Finney. The sleeve for the 1988 CD single reissue shows Colin Campbell from the 1964 film The Leather Boys. This artwork had previously been used in Germany for the single "Ask".  When the band performed the song on Top of the Pops, Morrissey ripped open his shirt to reveal the words "MARRY ME" written on his chest ("Would you like to marry me?" is one line of the song).', 9, 1),
(30, 'This Charming Man', '"This Charming Man" is a song by the English band The Smiths, written by guitarist Johnny Marr and singer/lyricist Morrissey. It was released as the group''s second single in October 1983 on the independent record label Rough Trade. The song is defined by Marr''s jangle pop guitar riff and Morrissey''s characteristically morose lyrics, which revolve around the recurrent Smiths themes of sexual ambiguity and lust. Feeling detached from and unable to relate to the early 1980s mainstream gay culture, Morrissey wrote "This Charming Man" to evoke an older, more coded and self-aware underground scene. The singer explained of the song''s lyrics, "I really like the idea of the male voice being quite vulnerable, of it being taken and slightly manipulated, rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody." Although only moderately successful on first release—the single peaked at number 25 on the British singles chart—"This Charming Man" has been widely praised in both the music and mainstream press. The single was re-issued in 1992, reaching number 8 on the UK singles chart (making it The Smiths'' biggest UK hit by chart position). In 2004, BBC Radio 2 listeners voted it number 97 on the station''s "Sold On Song Top 100" poll. Mojo magazine journalists placed the track at number one on their 2008 "50 Greatest UK Indie Records of All Time" feature.', 9, 1),
(31, 'How Soon Is Now?', '"How Soon Is Now?" is a song by the British alternative rock band The Smiths. Written by Smiths singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, it was originally a B-side of the 1984 single "William, It Was Really Nothing". "How Soon Is Now?" was subsequently featured on the compilation album Hatful of Hollow and on U.S., Canadian, Australian and Warner UK editions of the group''s second album Meat Is Murder (1985). It was belatedly released as a single in the UK in 1985, where it reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart.  Sire Records chief Seymour Stein called it "the ''Stairway to Heaven'' of the Eighties", while co-writer Johnny Marr described it as "possibly our most enduring record. It''s most people''s favourite, I think." Despite its prominent place in The Smiths'' repertoire, however, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band''s style. Although a club favourite, "How Soon Is Now?" did not chart as well as expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; however, the 7" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations. The song has been widely praised for, among other things, the artistry of its lyrics. A cover of the song by Love Spit Love was used in the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Craft, as well as the film "The Crow" and later appeared as the theme song of the television series Charmed for all eight of its seasons. The song briefly made an appearance in the 4th episode of BBC''s show Inside the Human Body.
