    Description:
    This is the footer for the site. The footer has been put into it's own file 
    so that the html doesn't have to be copy and pasted into the 'main' pages. 
    NOTE: This should only ever be 'included/required'. It is not intended to 
    be viewed on it's own. -Andrew                                           -->
