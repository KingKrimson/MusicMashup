     Description: 
     On first viewing, this lists all of the users in the database, along 
     with some basic information about them, such as their avatar and age.
     If you click on a user, you're taking to their specific page, which
     shows you the user's description, and a list of all the artists and
     tracks they favourited.                                                 -->
